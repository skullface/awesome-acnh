## Tips

### General gameplay, quirks, and delights
* If you need to craft something on your island but you’re far from one of your own benches, try popping into one of your villager’s houses to see if their DIY Craft bench is out, or use the one by Tom Nook inside Resident Services!
* If you are physically sharing your Nintendo Switch, the first account to play the game owns the island and dictates initial progress.
* If you want to get rid of an item in your pocket and cannot re-sell it or give it away, you can permanently throw them out in a garbage can if you have one placed in your home or outside.

#### Flora
* Palm trees only grow in sand (either from your beaches or a sand path via the Island Designer NookPhone app).
* You cannot give uprooted flowers or trees to another villager or player, nor store them in your house. 
* You may plant uprooted flowers in your pocket on another player’s island, even if you aren’t Best Friends.
* Trees can be uprooted by eating food and using your shovel to dig up the tree.
* Trees need at least 1 empty space in all directions around them to grow. Once a tree is fully grown, it can be moved to be closer to other objects (other trees, furniture, flowers, fencing, etc.) by uprooting it and replanting it.

#### Time
* Weather changes only occur on the hour.
* The exception to a new day’s changes occuring at 5:00 am (see: [Timing](#timing)) are critters appearing or disappearing at the start of a new month. These changes occur at midnight when the local date changes.

#### Eating
* If you eat food before you hit a stone, it will break. The stone will reappear a new area the following day.
* If you’ve eaten more food than you’d like, try sitting on a toilet.

#### Music
* If you place more than one stereo in a room in your house, it will amplify the registered song.
* Each stereo placed outside can play a different registered song, but you‘ll only hear the closest one. Your villagers will pay attention to music they hear!
* Your villagers will be interested in instruments placed outside.

#### Clothing and designs
* If you create outfits with a Wand, the wearable items in the outfits are “stored” in the Wand and are unusable in other outfits.
* The following items retain their most recent customization even after the art in the custom design slot is deleted or changed: island flag, phone case, face paint.

### Visiting other islands
* Don’t run through flowers. It takes time for the blooms to grow back. Be sure to walk wherever you see flowers.
* Don’t leave by pressing the <kbd>-</kbd> button. It will interrupt the progress of every other visitor’s interactions. 
* Ask before you buy one of the 2-3 furniture items at the back wall of Nook’s Cranny or art from Jolly Redd. These items can only be purchased once, so it’s polite to ask if it’s okay for you to buy it. (The small items on the table at Nook’s and furniture from Jolly Redd have no purchase limit. And you can always offer to let the island owner catalog the Nook’s item!)
* Don’t shake trees, chop wood, grab shells, pick flowers, etc. without asking first. Most friends will be totally okay with you taking replenishable resources, but it’s always polite to ask.
* If you’re visiting a stranger for a trade, it’s polite not to talk to their residents. Villagers will remember you and ask about you, and it can be awkward and unwanted for a neighbor to ask about a stranger that came by for a deal!
* Unlike Sahara, Leif, Kicks, etc., you can only buy one piece of art from any Jolly Redd per day and obtain one recipe from any Celeste per night.
* Adding a player to your Best Friends list via the NookPhone means you can use your shovel and axe tools on their island.
* If you’re visiting an island for a particular recipe a villager is crafting at their DIY bench, check the map on your NookPhone to see where their house is!
* Download the [Nintendo Switch Online app](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/online-service/app/) for your phone to use the NookLink feature to type messages in-game using your phone’s keyboard instead of the game controller.

### Friendship with villagers
* Friendship rankings do not correlate with move-out requests, which are randomized. <sup>[`source`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8kQMnmduhraliqCrehaAviG0qlm5BnAb73rPPOf-z0/edit#heading=h.kmdduxio23l3)</sup>
* Certain actions will raise or lower your friendship ranking with your villagers. <sup>[`source`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8kQMnmduhraliqCrehaAviG0qlm5BnAb73rPPOf-z0/edit#heading=h.kmdduxio23l3)</sup>
  * **Raise friendship ranking**
    * Talk to them (once per day)
    * Send them a letter (increases when they reply)
    * Give them a present (when ranking is already high)
    * Give them a wrapped birthday gift
    * Complete a request for them
    * Sell them an item they want
  * **Lower friendship ranking**
    * Hit them with a tool
    * Push them around a lot
    * Give them trash items (tire, boot, weeds, rotten turnips, etc.)
    * Decline a request
    * Accept a request but fail to carry it out
* For much more information on how to affect friendship and what friendship means in the game, see the links in the [Friendship](#friendship) resources category.

<sup>⚠️ <em>Potential spoiler content!</em></sup>

### Wisp
After you complete Wisp’s quest you can choose between two options:

* **Something you don’t have yet**: Wisp will pick a random item that you don’t have in your Nook Shopping list worth ≤1,500 Bells or less. If your catalog is complete, a random item worth ≤1,500 bells. Once your house is upgraded from a tent, you have the following chances of item type:
  * Furniture: 40%
  * Wallpaper/Flooring: 24%
  * Bed: 24%
  * Clothing: 12%
* **Something expensive**: Wisp will pick an item with a buying price of ≤10,000 Bells.

### Redd

Starting in the **Earth Day Update (1.2.0)**, [Redd](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Redd) and [Jolly Redd's Treasure Trawler](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Jolly_Redd%27s_Treasure_Trawler) will begin to randomly visit your island (Players need to already have [donated at least 60 items to the museum](https://twitter.com/_Ninji/status/1253290680731959299). Redd's visits are random. Players are able to purchase art and furniture from Redd, but some art is faked. After purchasing the first piece of art from Redd, Blathers will upgrade the Museum to include an art gallery.

## Tool durability
Tools only wear down when your action is successful. Ladders, Vaulting Poles, and Wands will not break. Watering empty land decreases a Watering Can’s durability by 10% of its use on flower(s). <sup>[`source`](https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acnh-guide/2020/3/31/21194209/durability-list-broken-breaking-shovel-axe-fishing-rod-watering-can-slingshot-bug-net)</sup>
